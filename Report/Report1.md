# Progress Report : Week 01

# Team: Numbani

s124002 Tang Ziqiang:

First of all, we entered the link in the email and made a team.  The name of our team is Numbani, which is from overwatch.

After accepting the assignment, a new repository was prepared with the same name as our team.

In sol system, we need a path. So I used csh and the command is:

**$ echo &quot;set path = ($path /home/course/ie-soft1/usr/bin/Git/git-1.9.5/)&quot; \&gt;\&gt; ~/.cshrc**

**$ source ~/.cshrc**

and then we can use git command to check.

After building the path, we cloned the project. Before that, in the terminal, we used git config:

**$ git config --global user.email &quot;s1242002@u-aizu.ac.jp.com&quot;**

**$ git config --global user.name &quot;s1242002&quot;**

**$ git config --list**

Because whenIcontribute our team project, I must clone team project to my local

environment as a local repository from remote repository. So:

**$ git clone \&lt;repository\_url\&gt;\&lt;local\_path\&gt;**

Finally, we need push a readme.md with commit. So we commit &quot;first commit&quot; and pushed the master branch.

I also cloned the project to my PC in eclipse, using Egit. Just following the tutorial was ok.







s1242004 Wang Zidu:

First, made our team with s1242002, Tang Zigiang, and decide the team name as Numbani.

Then we tried to set the environment and github account following the tutorial.

To set the path of git, we used the following command:

**$ echo &quot;set path = ($path /home/course/ie-soft1/usr/bin/Git/git-1.9.5/)&quot; \&gt;\&gt; ~/.cshrc**

**$ source ~/.cshrc**

And almost the same process as s1242002, I set my local project space with the following command:

**$ git config --global user.email &quot;s1242004@u-aizu.ac.jp.com&quot;**

**$ git config --global user.name &quot;s1242004&quot;**

**$ git config --list**
